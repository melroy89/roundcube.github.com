title: Multi-arch Docker Images for Roundcube
tags: releases docker
---
With the latest release of Roundcube webmail we proudly announce that the Docker images
published under [rouncube/roundcubemail](https://hub.docker.com/r/roundcube/roundcubemail/)
are now multi-platform and can be run on the following architectures:

* linux/386
* linux/amd64
* linux/arm/v6
* linux/arm/v7
* linux/arm64
* linux/ppc64le
* linux/s390x

The multi-arch builds have been a feature request for a long time and finally became possible with 
the power of Github actions and the much appreciated contribution by 
[William Desportes](https://github.com/williamdes) and [Montgomery Auber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/montgomery-auber-658405259/)

Starting with version 1.6.0 all Docker images will now be released multi-arch enabling Roundcube to
run on Raspberry Pi, M1 Macs, AWS EC2 Graviton and many other environments without custom builds.

The list of architectures we support is limited to the archs available for [php](https://hub.docker.com/_/php)
and [composer](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer).
